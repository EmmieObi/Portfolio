## ABOUT ME

Hello! I'm Emmanuel Obisesan ü§ì
I'm a data analyst and client management professional with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. With several years of experience across sales, operations, and client management, I‚Äôve seen firsthand how data drives client retention, operational efficiency, and business growth. This realization sparked my journey into data analysis, where I‚Äôve trained and worked with tools like Power BI, Excel, and SQL to uncover trends, build dashboards, and support smarter decision-making. This GitHub space showcases my learning journey, hands-on projects, and continuous growth in the world of data and analytics.

This project provides a detailed analysis of a superstore's sales performance from 2010 to 2013. It covers key business metrics such as total sales, profit/loss, processing time, customer orders, and regional performance. Through interactive dashboards, I highlighted trends in order volume, sales by region, and top-performing products. The goal was to generate insights that support better decision-making around inventory, customer targeting, and operational efficiency.
