## ABOUT ME

Hello! I'm Emmanuel Obisesan 🤓
I'm a data analyst and client management professional with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. With several years of experience across sales, operations, and client management, I’ve seen firsthand how data drives client retention, operational efficiency, and business growth. This realization sparked my journey into data analysis, where I’ve trained and worked with tools like Power BI, Excel, and SQL to uncover trends, build dashboards, and support smarter decision-making. This GitHub space showcases my learning journey, hands-on projects, and continuous growth in the world of data and analytics.

## WHAT I DO

**- ✅ Data Wrangling.**
I clean and transform messy, unstructed data using tools like Excel and Power BI, preparing it for accurate and efficient analysis.

**- ✅ Insight Generation and Data Visualization.**
Beyond data wrangling, I specialize in generating business insights through data visualization with Power BI, turning data into clear, actionable insights to help you make data-driven decisions, optimize processes, and drive business growth.
